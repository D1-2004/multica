# DingTalk Account Binding Router Contract

Multica and Agent Message Router communicate in both directions, with two
independent address contracts.

## Multica to Router

Multica calls Router through the fixed HTTP base URL configured for the Router
client. The request destination is always the Agent Message Router service; it
is never derived from a binding record or a Multica callback address.

```text
AGENT_MESSAGE_ROUTER_INTERNAL_URL + /api/account-binding-tokens
```

To issue a short-lived DingTalk account-binding credential, Multica sends only
the callback path as business data:

```http
POST /api/account-binding-tokens
Authorization: Bearer <service credential>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "agentId": "<agent UUID>",
  "dispatchPath": "/api/webhooks/agent-dispatch/<endpointId>"
}
```

Router returns the credential and its expiry. It does not return a callback
origin or a full callback URL:

```json
{
  "bindingToken": "<short-lived token>",
  "expiresAt": "<RFC3339 timestamp>"
}
```

Multica keeps `dispatchPath` in the pending binding and places the same path in
the QR-code fragment. It does not replace its local dispatch endpoint with a
URL supplied by Router.

## Router to Multica

`dispatchPath` identifies the Multica webhook but deliberately contains no
environment origin. Router persists the canonical path in its shared database.
When Router actually dispatches a task, the running Router environment combines
that path with its own configured Multica callback origin:

```text
MESSAGE_ROUTER_MULTICA_DISPATCH_ORIGIN + dispatchPath
```

Pre-release and production Router deployments can therefore share binding data
without persisting a pre-release callback origin into a record later consumed
by production. The Router HTTP API base URL and the Multica callback origin are
separate configuration values with opposite communication directions.

## History

- 2026-07-22: Removed the incorrect `dispatchUrl` field from the Router token
  response contract and changed the QR binding payload to carry
  `dispatchPath`. Router now resolves the full callback URL only when it
  dispatches a task.
- 2026-07-21: Changed binding-token requests from a full `dispatchUrl` to
  `dispatchPath` so callers no longer provide an environment origin.

## Reason

The previous implementation confused the fixed Multica-to-Router HTTP request
address with the environment-specific Router-to-Multica callback address. Since
pre-release and production Router deployments share a database, persisting a
full callback URL can route production traffic to an isolated pre-release host.
Persisting only the path and resolving the current environment origin at
dispatch time prevents that cross-environment leak.
